1. Using fetch() to retrieve data / HTML Output

  - I have created a repo `cpnt-rest-api`
     - Added files and folders
  - Tried bunch of api's at first but they did not cover the requirement of assignment and then i found `studio ghibli` it had almost every thing 
  - Using starter code we did in class i finished fetching data from api
  - HTML: h1,p and links

2. Interactivity
  
  - Created button in html 
  - Created a function and called the `fatchData` 
  - I was having problem. when i refresh button, on html page i had only
  button it took me while then i realize this that i can call th function 
  once as ` fetchData(endpoint)` and then
  i can call it in button function
  - So i get the page once but it dosent refresh again

3. Error handling
