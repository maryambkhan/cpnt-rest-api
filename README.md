1. Using fetch() to retrieve data / HTML Output

  - I have created a repo `cpnt-rest-api`
     - Added files and folders
  - Tried bunch of api's at first but they did not cover the requirement of assignment and then i found `studio ghibli` it had almost every thing 
  - Using starter code we did in class i finished fetching data from api
  - HTML: h1,p and links

2- Interactivity
